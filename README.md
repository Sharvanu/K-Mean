# 🎯 K-Means Clustering – Python Implementation

This repository contains a clear and visual implementation of the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm.  
The script demonstrates how K-Means groups data points into clusters by repeatedly updating centroid positions.

K-Means is one of the most widely used **unsupervised learning algorithms** for discovering hidden structures in datasets.
